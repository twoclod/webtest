		Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:Walla Walla, WA,Magic City, ID,Bountiful, UT,Last Chance, CO,Truth or Consequences, NM,Why, AZ
		</p>
		<p>
		I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity. I definitely won't be passing any cars.

		My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:cellphone,iPod,digital camera and a protein bar.Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.
